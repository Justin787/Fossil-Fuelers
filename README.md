# Fossil-Fuelers
Fossil Fuelers is a dinosaur drag racing game that I made in my AP Computer Science class during my junior year in high school.

I added a separate folder to view some examples of my code.

The Executable folder can be downloaded and used to play Fossil Fuelers on any Windows PC(Designed for Windowed 1024x768 resolution).
