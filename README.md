# Fossil-Fuelers
Fossil Fuelers is a dinosaur drag racing game that I made in my AP Computer Science class during my junior year in high school. The object of the game is to shift gears and accelerate quicker than the opposing dinosaur. This game features split screen, as well as AI.

I added a separate folder to view some examples of my code.

The Executable folder can be downloaded and used to play Fossil Fuelers on any Windows PC(Designed for Windowed 1024x768 resolution).
